### inspried by Udacity's python course. But I need a more customized program for self-using.
**Project objective:** Build a log system to promote the working efficiency.

**Project basic idea:** Break the working schedule into time intervals. At the end of each time interval, a window jumps out and music plays. User need to record what he or she did in the previous time intervals. The program will automatic record the information into log, which is represented as text file named by the current date.

In brief, the program will work as following steps:
1. start the program.
1. pick up a song for each break to play
1. set up how long the intervals should be
1. start to run.

Then each time the window jumps out. User need to record what he or she has done in the prevous passed intervel. The program will write those into the log.

Language intended to use to implement: Java
Music format: MP3
Log format: text file
